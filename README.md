## Considerations

-   The app is still in development and may contain bugs, the main focus was to get the basic functionality working.
-   The app is not optimized for tablets or larger screens.
-   Not all best practices were followed, as the main focus was to get the basic functionality working(AGIAIN).
-   The shall have a unified experience with its iOS counterpart, which is still in development.
